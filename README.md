# RL-project

Implementing Dialogue Systems via Q-Networking. 

## To-Do
1. Explore the topics.
2. Create a proposal.
3. Learn about how the DQN algorithm works.
4. Do basic planning for all the algorithms.
5. Initialize a Jupyter Notebook.
6. Plan out and install any needed packages in Python.
7. Retrieve any datasets useful for training.
8. Begin setting up the needed environments for training.
9. Implement a basic draft of the Q-Networking algorithm.
10. Prepare a series of test cases for the algorithm.
11. Debug the algorithm and touch up any bugs or shortfalls found.
12. Improve upon the basic implementation.
13. Develop an advanced algorithm and set up test cases for it.
14. Submit the checkpoint.
15. Fine-tuning the model by first testing hyperparams.
16. Optimize the hyperparameters via a framework like Optuna.
17. Submit final project.
18. Prepare for the presentation.
19. Set up presentation slides.
20. Prepare results for the presentation.
